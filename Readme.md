- Sanity check the metadata with lastFM's records before scrobbling.
- View info about a track, such as listener count charts, album art etc
- View recent scrobbles
- Work with recent scrobbles (e.g. love a track, cancel a scrobble)
- Offline scrobbling with job scheduler
- Offline viewing of cached data

#### This is not intended to:
- an app to browse lastfm.
