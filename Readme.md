#### This is intended for:
- Scrobbling to lastfm from anything which produces audio with metadata, including the official youtube app, a chat app or some less known chinese player
- Sanity check the metadata with lastFM's records before scrobbling.
- View info about a track, such as listener count charts, album art etc
- View recent scrobbles
- Work with recent scrobbles (e.g. love a track, cancel a scrobble)
- Offline scrobbling with job scheduler
- Offline viewing of cached data
- Check what your friends are listening to

#### This is not intended to be:
- an app to browse lastfm.
- to contain any webviews. Links would rather open in the browser
- contain any kind of ADs
